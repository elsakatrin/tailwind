# tailwind
Site was supped to be prettier but I ran out of time and me and tailwind arenÂ´t a good match! Not right now atleast :) 
I think Tailwind has a steep learning curve and takes time to get into.
Not all styles were working for me here. I wanted to do hover over links in nav and on images on site
The main image on the site was supposed to be round but would not go full so ended up like this
The site was supposed to have different colors. When I uploaded them I got lots of problems so I ended up just using some random color. If you're interested I put the hex code of the color I was going to use.
Ran into problems with tailwind but I believe tailwind can be comforable and quick use if everything runs smoootly!
